# Long read QC summary exercise

# Bash code chunck
# Use conda to install filtlong package
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
conda install filtlong

# Filter the long read fastq file to keep the longest 75% of the sequesnce
filtlong -p 75 ERR1539001.fastq > output/ERR1539001_75filtered.fastq

# Run Sequali on the filtered file
sequali --outdir ./sequali_reports ./output/ERR1539001_75filtered.fastq


# Brief description of changes after filtration

# N50 is better compred to the non filtered file, it went from 6681 to 7371

# Most reads are longer than 2000 bp, the 1st percentile is at 2424 which is higher than the 25th percentile from the unfiltered file

# The read length histogram is unimodel with a single peak, which is less wide than the unfiltered file but doesn't have the second small peak of smaller length reads the unfiltered file had

# Average Q scores are all above 7 and the lowest is just below 20 whereas the unfiltered file some Q scores went below 10.

# The bese-level quality is relatively flat and does not drop sharply, more flat than the unfiltered file

# this sequence run is of better quality than the unfiltered file and I would use it in down stream analysis
